## Actions and UI.
In order to toggle the action from the desktop, a test UI have been added. It's basic but allow a UI way to toggle all actions. More work has to be done around the UI. We need a better integration with the original window. Currently, there is no way to type a custom answer to an sms UI wise. The gnome-shell extension is still envisaged. Also, we still don't have a way to know that a notification was closed on the linux side ([bugzilla](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=751516)).


## Service discovery.
The service discovery is finished. Nuntius-linux now look for any android device that have a nuntius server launched. It can even connect to them automatically. Nuntius-android can connect to multiple nuntius-linux and vice-versa.


## The pairing process.
Now, when nuntius-linux tries to connect to a phone that hasn't trusted it's certificate, it automatically shows the qr-code view and on android the scanner view. As soon as you scanned it and pressed the "ok" button on linux the server will reconnect succesfully to the android.
Nuntius is also now indepedent of any app for the qr code view. The android app display tips on how to pair correcty.
