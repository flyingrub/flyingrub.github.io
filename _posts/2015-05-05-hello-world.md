# Hello world !

#### This is markdown.

I already like this. :)

> Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety. __Benjamin Franklin__

```python
import sys
print("hello world !")
sys.exit(0)
```

I want to warn you that i will be very concise in my posts. Mainly because i like being minimalist and i don't know how to do otherwise :).


#### This is a test post.

As you can see this is a test post of the jekyll framework, if you can see it, everything is fine.
